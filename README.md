# Read My Steak

## Description
Read My Steak is a README file generator that prompts questions to fill out a professional README file. <br>
With this project I solved the need to memorize what a professional README file contains by following the questions being prompt. <br>
Using Node was interesting because it is the introduction to backend coding. <br>
With this project I learned how to install and use NPM's that can help a lot with coding.
