# Read My Steak

## Description
Read My Steak is a README file generator that prompts questions to fill out a professional README file. <br>
With this project I solved the need to memorize what a professional README file contains by following the questions being prompt. <br>
Using Node was interesting because it is the introduction to backend coding. <br>
With this project I learned how to install and use NPM's that can help a lot with coding.
## Installation
Navigate to the project folder. <br>
Install "inquirer" npm by typing "npm i inquirer 8.2.4"

## Usage
Navigate to the project's folder inside the terminal. <br>
Run node by typing "node index.js" in the terminal. <br>
Fill out the questions being prompt in the terminal. <br>
Open the README file generated.

## Credits
